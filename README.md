Object Problems
It's time to get some practice using Objects! Below we've included a link to download a zip file for a number of problems.

Complete the problems in the order specified.

To run the tests for the above problems you will need to unzip the file you downloaded and then navigate into the directory for that file. Once there you can run the following two commands:

~ npm install
~ npm test
The npm install commands will install all the testing dependencies.

The npm test command will run all the tests. If you have any trouble with this don't hesitate to ask a TA for help!
